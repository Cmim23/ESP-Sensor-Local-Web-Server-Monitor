# ESP-Sensor-Local-Web-Server-Monitor
I've developed a compact local web server using an ESP8266 12E and a DHT11 Humidity/Temperature Sensor. This server is easily accessible from anywhere as long as you have the IP address and an internet connection.
It's main qualities are being very compact and extremely cheap to make, around $5 total.
